I developed the Onboarding Integration Service to help KYC service providers have a smooth integration with the blockchain and the Polymesh Unique Identity System (PUIS).

Along with building the tech, I also took part in evaluating and selecting KYC vendors and partners, to join the network and help support the network's vision of a compliant blockchain.

I've also contributed to the company's blog with a post about this service, follow the link for more info!
