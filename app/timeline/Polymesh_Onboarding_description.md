I developed the Onboarding Integration Service to help KYC service providers have a smooth integration with the blockchain and the Polymesh Unique Identity System (PUIS). This post highlights some of the challenges faced by KYC service providers and how the Onboarding Integration Service simplifies the process.

Along with building the tech, I also took part in evaluating and selecting KYC vendor and partners to join the network to help support the network's vision of a compliant blockchain.

I've also contributed to the company's blog with a post about this service, follow the link for more info!
