The International Cancer Genome Consortium Accelerating Research in Genomic Oncology (ICGC ARGO).

I lead the frontend and public API development, working closely with designer, backend developers, business analyst and bioinformaticians to deliver a 
user-friendly and performant platform for researchers to submit and access and large-scale genomic and clinical data.

Till today, ICGC Argo remains one of my favorite professional projects. ❤️
