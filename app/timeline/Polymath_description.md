Polymath provides technology to create, issue, and manage digital securities on the blockchain.

I built dApps and layer-2 services running on the Polymesh network, most notably leading the development of the network's onboarding pipeline and technical collaboration with third-party KYC provider.

With my business background in finance, Polymath was an opportunity to get in touch with a part of me that felt long-gone. Here my knowledge of corporate finance actually came in quite helpful. üè¶
