  If you ever find yourself maintaining long-running Docker containers on a Linux host,
  capturing and managing container logs can be a tricky task. This article might provide some insights.

# TL;DR
- When running Docker containers on a bare Linux OS, managing log files is best done by the host machine, not the application container.
- This can be achieved by:
  1. Configuring the Docker daemon to use the `syslog` driver.
  2. Configuring `rsyslog` to direct logs to a separate file.
  3. Configuring log rotation with `logrotate`.
- In practice, unless there are special needs (e.g., specialized hardware), it’s not advisable to run Docker directly on bare Linux machines in production. If you’re building a new application in 2025, consider:
  - A serverless model (e.g., Next.js with Vercel or Netlify).
  - A container orchestration service (e.g., AWS ECS, EKS, or Kubernetes on GCP).

# The Problem

Due to a specialized hardware requirement, I inherited a system deployable only on bare-metal Linux boxes. As with any long-running service, capturing and rotating logs was crucial. Here were the basic requirements:
- **Logs must be captured on disk for archiving.**
- **Log files must be rotated periodically and removed** to prevent build-up.
- **Log file content must follow a consistent format** to enable parsing by reporting systems.

The system had multiple application components, each running in its own Docker container. Initially, the solution implemented these logging requirements in the applications themselves, using:
- Logging libraries (e.g., `winston` for Node.js and the `logging` module for Python).
- Custom implementations for C/C++ applications.

Logs were written to a shared volume mounted on all containers. However, this approach introduced several issues:
1. Inconsistent implementation across applications.
2. Additional complexity requiring developer attention.
3. Operators had no direct control over log rotation policies.
4. Log management was tied to the container’s lifecycle. If a container failed to start, its logs might never be rotated.

Over time, it became clear this solution was unsustainable. Here’s the improved approach we adopted.

# The Solution

Instead of implementing logging logic in applications, the applications logged to standard I/O, while the host OS handled the rest using [`syslog`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syslog).

**Note:** This solution is based on Ubuntu servers; specifics may vary for other Linux distributions.

### 1. Configure Docker Daemon to Use the `syslog` Driver

The Docker daemon configuration is typically found at `/etc/docker/daemon.json`. Update it to include:

```json
{
  "log-driver": "syslog",
  "log-opts": {
    "syslog-address": "unixgram:///dev/log",
    "tag": "docker_containers.log",
    "syslog-facility": "daemon"
  }
}
```

Explanation:
- `log-driver`: Specifies the `syslog` logging driver.
- `syslog-address`: Specifies the host’s system logging entry point (`/dev/log`). Remote syslog servers using TCP or UDP are also supported.
- `tag`: Attaches a tag to each log line to help direct logs to the appropriate file later.
- `syslog-facility`: Defines the facility level for logs (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syslog#Facility)).

Restart the Docker service to apply changes:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart docker
```

To verify, you can tail the system logs:
```bash
sudo tail -f /var/log/syslog
```

You can test with an ephemeral container:
```bash
docker run -it bash -c "echo hello"
```

### 2. Configure `rsyslog` to Direct Logs to a Separate File

To separate container logs from other system logs, configure `rsyslog`:

1. Create a new configuration file:
```bash
sudo touch /etc/rsyslog.d/docker-containers.conf
```

2. Edit the file to include:
```conf
$template DockerContainerLogs,"/var/log/%syslogtag"

if $syslogtag contains 'docker_containers.log' then -?DockerContainerLogs

& stop
```

The `$syslogtag` corresponds to the `log-opts.tag` set in `daemon.json`.

Restart `rsyslog` to apply the configuration:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart rsyslog
```

Now, all Docker container logs are captured in `/var/log/docker_containers.log`.

### 3. Configure Log Rotation

To prevent `docker_containers.log` from growing indefinitely, configure `logrotate`:

1. Create a new file:
```bash
sudo touch /etc/logrotate.d/docker-containers
```

2. Add the following configuration:
```conf
/var/log/docker_containers.log {
    daily
    rotate 7
    create 0640 syslog adm
    missingok
    notifempty
}
```

This configuration:
- Rotates the log file daily.
- Keeps seven days’ worth of logs.
- Creates new log files with `0640` permissions under `syslog adm` ownership.
- Skips rotation if the file is missing or empty.

### 4. Caveats

Logs must be properly directed to the container’s console. Ensure:
1. The main application process runs with PID 1 (tools like [`tini`](https://github.com/krallin/tini) can help), or
2. Run containers with TTY enabled:
   - `docker run -t ...`
   - Include `tty: true` in `docker-compose.yaml`.

# Conclusion

This approach centralizes log management on the host machine, offering:
1. Consistent metadata for all logs.
2. Standardized log formats.
3. Simplified application development, as logging logic is offloaded to the host.

While managing Docker containers on bare Linux is complex, this method mitigates some challenges. 
However, unless specific requirements apply (e.g., specialized hardware, high-security systems, 
or a delivery model targeting host deployments), modern systems are better suited for container 
orchestrators or serverless models. I'd like to touch on these on a future post.
