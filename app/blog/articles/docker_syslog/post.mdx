  If you ever find yourself having to maintain long-running docker containers in a linux host,
  capturing and managing container logs can be a tricky task. This article might provide a hint.

# The problem

Due to specialized hardware requirement, a system I inherited was only deployable on bare-metal
Linux boxes. As any long-running service goes, being able to capture and rotate logs were crucial
in the operation of such system. Here's are basic requirements:
- The logs must be **captured in disk for archiving**
- The log files must be **rotated periodically and removed** from disk to avoid build-up
- The log file **content must follow a consistent format** to be parsed by reporting system

There were multiple application components, each running in its own Docker container. To achieve
the above goals, the original system had the applications implement these logging logics, either 
through logging libraries (such as `winston` for Node.js applications, and the `logging` module
for Python), or a fully custom implementation in the case of C/C++. A common volumn was then mounted
on all logging containers to capture the logs generated. This presents a few problems:
 1. Inconsistent implementation across different applications
 1. Additional complexities in application requiring developer attention
 1. Operator did not have direct control over the log rotation policy
 1. The log management is tied to container's life, so if a container is having issue starting,
 its logs may never get rotated

Over time, this was clearly not a sustainable solution.

# The solution

Instead of leaving it to the applications to implement these logging logic, it's possible to simply let
the appplication log to standard IO, then handle the rest at the host OS through [`syslog`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syslog).

***Note:*** I operate mostly on Ubuntu servers, the specific for your flavour of Linux might differ.

To do this, we need to:

### 1. Configure Docker daemon to use `syslog` driver:
My Docker daemon config was found at `/etc/docker/daemon.json`. I editted this to something like so:
  ```json
  {
    // ... other configs
    "log-driver": "syslog",
    "log-opts": {
      "syslog-address": "unixgram:///dev/log",
      "tag": "docker_containers.log",
      "syslog-facility": "daemon"
    }
  }
  ```
Here we are specifying:
- `log-driver` tells Docker which logging driver to use, in this case, `syslog`
- `log-opts` includes the specific configuration for the driver [as documented here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/logging/drivers/syslog/#options).
In this case, we have:
  - `syslog-address`: specify that we want to use the host machine's standard system logging entry point
  at `/dev/log`. Theoretically, a remote syslog server that implements the `syslog` protocol over `tcp`
  or `udp` can also be used.
  - `tag`: a tag to attach to each log line. This will help us direct the logs to the right file later.
  - `syslog-facility`: see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syslog#Facility)

Once updated, restart the docker service as so:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl restart docker
  ```
Once my containers are back, I can now see my Docker containers logging to `/var/log/syslog`, by following it
like so:
  ```bash
  sudo tail -f /var/log/syslog
  ```

### 2. Configure `rsyslog` to direct logs to individual files
The folder `/etc/rsyslog.d` contains rsyslog configurations for log processing rules. We can start with creating
a new configuration file, say `docker-containers.conf` with the command:
  ```bash 
  sudo touch /etc/rsyslog.d/docker-containers.conf
  ```
Your config file may look something like:
  ```conf
  $template DockerContainerLogs,"/var/log/%syslogtag"

  if $syslogtag contains 'docker_containers.log'  then -?DockerContainerLogs

  & stop
  ```
Here `$syslogtag` corresponds to to the `log-opts.tag` configured in the `/etc/docker/daemon.json` config earlier.

Once the update is complete, `rsyslog` needs to be restarted like so:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl restart rsyslog
  ```

We now have all docker container logs being captured in `/var/log/docker_containers.log`.  I kept it simple by piping 
everything into one file, but it is possible to include further splitting by attaching the container names and other info 
on the file name.

### 3. Configure log rotation and cleanup
If we leave things as is, the `docker_containers.log` file will continue to grow indefinitely, eventually taking up
all the disk space in our host machine. To prevent this, we can configure log rotation to do the following:
  
  1. **Periodically rotate the content of `docker_containers.log` into a new file and empty out `docker_containers.log`**

      This can be achieved by configuring `logrotate`. The configuration is typically broken down into multiple
      files under `/etc/logrotate.d`, so I created a new file `/etc/logrotate.d/docker-containers`, which looks
      like so: 
      ```
      /var/log/containers/docker_containers.log {
          daily
          rotate 7
          create 0640 syslog adm
          missingok
          notifempty
          postrotate
              /usr/lib/rsyslog/rsyslog-rotate
          endscript
      }
      ```
      This configuration effectively says: ***"rotate docker_containers.log every 2 day, creating the new file with `0604`
      permission, under `syslog adm` ownership, skip the operation if the file is missing or empty"***
  
      Overtime, we will have files like so:
      ```bash
      minhified@host:~$ ll /var/log/ | grep docker_containers.log
      -rw-r-----  1 syslog adm        33305 Jan  8 11:10 docker_containers.log
      -rw-r-----  1 syslog adm         7588 Jan  8 00:00 docker_containers.log.1
      -rw-r-----  1 syslog adm         8531 Jan  6 23:50 docker_containers.log.2
      -rw-r-----  1 syslog adm         7120 Jan  6 00:00 docker_containers.log.3
      -rw-r-----  1 syslog adm         7107 Jan  5 00:00 docker_containers.log.4
      -rw-r-----  1 syslog adm         8243 Jan  4 00:00 docker_containers.log.5
      -rw-r-----  1 syslog adm         7109 Jan  3 00:00 docker_containers.log.6
      -rw-r-----  1 syslog adm         7141 Jan  2 00:00 docker_containers.log.7
      ```
      This would allow us to operate on old logs without impacting the main `docker_containers.log` file.
      More intricate configurations can also be applied, such as specifying a size cutoff for the log file
      in addition to / instead of the periodical rotation. See [this](https://betterstack.com/community/guides/logging/how-to-manage-log-files-with-logrotate-on-ubuntu-20-04/) 
      for more details.
  2. **Configure a periodical cleanup**

      This is a simple cron job to periodically
