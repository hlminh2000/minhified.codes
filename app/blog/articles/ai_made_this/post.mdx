# TLDR, 

No, this post was not written with any AI involved.

Here's what I used:
1. **ChatGPT** for prompt generation
1. **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** for initial code generation
1. **V0** for initial setup
1. **Copilot** for ongoing development

If you're curious, the source code for this entire site is open at: [https://github.com/hlminh2000/portfolio](https://github.com/hlminh2000/portfolio)

Check it out, and you can buy me a coffee if you decide to clone it for yourself. ðŸ˜‰

# Introduction

Somehow for the entirety of my career, I've got away without a portfolio site... I decided to change
that this year. ***I didn't want a "resume on a webpage"***, I already have a LinkedIn page. **I wanted a 
custom product** where I can continuously build and experiment on, **a space where I can share my journey** 
in building tech, using tech. 

All that seemed like a lot of work, and **I'm no designer**, and frankly **too lazy to hand-code the design**. 
So it being 2025, I decided to see what happens if I **went all-in with using AIs for this**.

Though I have a lot of other tools and thoughts that I can go on about all day, I want to **focus this post on 
how AI tools made this timeline possible**. There will be **more posts to come about everything else involved.**

## 1. ChatGPT for prompt generation
  
I started with my own prompt:
> **Generate me a concept for portfolio webpage design to showcase my work as a full-stack engineer. 
  Imagine something that's modern, simple but creative, dark theme with gradient. Have sections for 
  "about me", "timeline", "blog", "get in touch".**

After feeding this to a few models, the result was underwhelming, so I thought **the prompt could be better**. 
I took the original prompt and dropped it into ChatGPT again, **asking the AI to improve the prompt**, like so:

> **Improve this prompt for better result: `Generate me a ...".`**

Which yielded:

> **Design a concept for a portfolio webpage to showcase the work of a senior full-stack engineer. 
The design should be modern, minimalistic, and creative, with a dark theme enhanced by subtle 
gradient accents. Include clearly defined sections: 'About Me' featuring a profile photo, a concise 
bio, and a navigation bar; 'Timeline' showcasing career milestones in an elegant vertical layout; 
'Blog' displaying previews of posts in a clean grid format with bold typography; and 
'Get in Touch' with a sleek contact form and prominent social media icons. Emphasize a professional 
yet engaging aesthetic, using smooth transitions, well-placed highlights, and a balanced layout.**

Clearly this is a much better prompt that actually describe what I was going for. I experimented with **feeding this
to ChatGPT and Gemini for concept art**, and once I was happy with the prompt, it was time to go get some code.

## 2. Claude for initial code generation

**Claude is known for its superior code generation.** I've actually been using Claude quite often on a day-to-day,
so naturally this was where I went to get the first batch of code.

My **original prompt** with Claude yielded the following:

<div className='relative overflow-scroll h-96 rounded-lg'>
  <OldPromptDesign />
</div>

With the **improved prompt** that ChatGPT gave me, the result was as follow:

<div className='relative overflow-scroll h-96 rounded-lg'>
  <Portfolio />
</div>

Already, we can see the resemblance to the site you're on. That's just to show how **a strong prompt makes 
all the difference**, thankfully **an LLM can help** with that too.

## 3. V0 for initial setup

If you haven't already, you should totally **check out [V0](https://V0.dev)**. I learned about it from
my friend Aaron at Vercel, its ability to **generate UI code over multiple files** that are nicely organized
is a game changer.

For this project, I knew **I wanted to use Next.js (which we will get into in another post)**, so I dropped the 
code that Claude gave me into V0, with the following prompt:

> **Set up a Next.js project with this code. For the timeline, include an optional image slots for visuals. 
  Generate a blogs page, and individual blog pages for each blog post. Do this with consistent formats 
  using the app router.**

**And voi-la!** ðŸ™Œ 

The **basic setup for my site was done**, even comes **with dynamic routing for the blog posts**:

<V0Response />

With a few more minor prompts, **V0 got me 90% of what I needed** to get started: 
- a basic layout
- a blog page
- the basic routing 
- basically a style guide that I can build on top of.

Once I got something I liked, it was a single command with **`shadcn` to bring these components into my
local setup** to start on the coding fun.

Claude and V0 have probably together **saved me a few days** compared to if I was to design and setup
everything myself.

## 4. Copilot for ongoing development

This one probably doesn't need much introduction. 

Aside from the autocomplete - which can be rather hit-or-miss -
it's particularly helpful for the kinds of **small things that's just not worth much time** to think about: 
being able to **highlight a nav bar that's broken on mobile and say *"make this responsive"*** is the kind of
productivity boost that **would have saved my soul in my early days** of web development. 

I can **focus on writing the code I want to write**, adding the finishing touches: tilting my profile
picture just right, adding subtle visual cues and interactions, implementing that annoying blob that's 
been following you around all this time, etc... and of course the content and system on how I manage them.

# Conclusion
This is **by no means to say that no human effort was involved** in the making of this site. There were **tons
of code I still have to** (or rather, **get to**) write, but being able to get a **unique design and setup 
put together in an hour** is a huge productivity boost.

Content site generation is certainly the "simpler" side of web development, so **this alone doesn't say much about
the usefulness of these tools for larger systems**, but they're **only going to get better**. I'm still
writing tons of code for this project, it's just **the type of code that I prefer to write**.

**I'm a developer** with - what I'd like to think - a decent eye for design, but I'm no designer. Likewise,
**how many amazing product designers out there** who don't have the capacity to sit down and realize their
beautiful designs?

**P.S.** There's a ton more things I'd like to share here, about other tools and tech that was used for this
project and beyond. Keep an eye out for more to come.
