title: API-less Web Apps and Fullstack Development

  For the majority of my time building web apps, the status quo has been a frontend talking 
  to a backend through some kind of custom web APIs. This might be coming to an end, and I'm 
  happy to see it go.

# TLDR,
Since we now have the tech to build SPAs without having to build web APIs, there'll be a lot
more web apps built without this. For web dev, I'm speculating the following changes:

1. Every web developer will become full-stack now
1. APIs will only make sense when there's a need for:
    1. Supporting multiple-clients (web, mobile, etc...)
    1. The API itself being a product
1. Some challenges:
    1. Security - without a standard around 

# Introduction
Single Page Apps (SPAs) have been the norm for a while now, and they are most commonly powered
by back-end APIs that allow them to read and write data without reloading entirely. While this
is not the only reason to build a server-side API, it is more often than not, the only reason 
why many of them exists.

Today we have have more options that allow the browser to call backend functions without having
to build a web API, at least I'm aware of:
  - **tRPC**
  - **Laraval Livewire**
  - **Next.js Server Actions**

Of course underneath the hood, the browser still has to communicate with a backend over AJAX calls,
however we simply won't be hand-coding web APIs anywhere nearly as often. For web development
overall, there'll be some implications.

***Ackowledgement:** I am predominently a JS developer, so my opinion is strongly skewed by the
developments in JS land, particularly with React and Next.js. I recognize that this is still in
the bleeding edge, and if these tools do take over, it won't be tomorrow - I myself am continuing
to work on APIs that are built specifically for the browser to consume.*

## 1. Everyone is full-stack now
Gone are the days when *"Front end developer"* were working on HTML, CSS and a sprinkle of JS for
novice interactivity. Since I got into the industry almost 10 years ago, the frontend has been 
ever growing in complexity.

Before Node.js was a thing, the skillset required to develop the frontend of a webapp and that of
the backend system was significantly different. Although the available language options were by no
means the only meaningful difference, it certainly was a big factor that made it difficult for 
a backend developer to be truly dive in and become skillful in the frontend, and vise versa. You
can't really be efficient at gaining hands-on experience building an API without first learning
Ruby, or PhP, etc... as a frontend dev.

Node.js was the first tech that set forth the rise of the modern day *"Full stack developers"* - which
I am one of. 

## 2. Web APIs will be less common
No we will still be building Web APIs (whether it be REST, GraphQL or RPC etc...), but they will
only make sense for specific situations.

## 3. Some challenges:
