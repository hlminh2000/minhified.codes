  For the majority of my time building web apps, the status quo has been a frontend talking 
  to a backend through some kind of web APIs. This might be coming to an end, and I'm happy
  to see it go.

# TLDR,
Since we now have the tech to build SPAs without having to build web APIs, there'll be a lot
more web apps built without this. For web dev, I'm speculating the following changes:

1. Every web developer will become full-stack now
1. APIs will only make sense when there's a need for:
    1. Supporting multiple-clients (web, mobile, etc...)
    1. The API itself being a product
1. Some challenges:
    1. Security - without a standard around 

# Introduction
Single Page Apps (SPAs) have been the norm for a while now, and they are most commonly powered
by back-end APIs that allow them to read and write data without reloading entirely. While this
is not the only reason to build a server-side API, it is more often than not, the only reason 
why many of them exists.

With the advent of tRPC and (mostly) Server Action in React, many of these APIs are no longer
needed. In this post, let's go into what this means for the web.

## 1. Everyone is full-stack now
With the modern web, it's been a while now that 

## 2. Use cases for APIs

## 3. Some challenges:
