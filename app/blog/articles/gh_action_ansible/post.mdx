In my <Link href={"/blog/articles/docker_syslog"}>recent post</Link>, I shared about managing Docker logs on bare-metal machines, which was a small, fun effort. 
But that project prompted me to revisit a much larger effort around the same system that I took on earlier: 
overhauling our deployment workflow. This post aims to share the high-level reasonings, and the changes path
we took.

# The Starting Point: An Overfiew the Original Setup
Our team operates Dockerized applications on bare-metal servers (a necessity due to specialized hardware). 
At the time of my joining, a simplified view of every deployment looks like so:

<Mermaid chart={`
sequenceDiagram
    participant GitHubActions as Github Actions
    participant S3
    participant CodeDeploy as AWS CodeDeploy
    participant Hosts as Hosts with codedeploy agent

    GitHubActions->>GitHubActions: Create Revision
    GitHubActions->>S3: Push Revision to S3
    GitHubActions->>CodeDeploy: Create deployment (referencing Revision in S3)
    Hosts->>+CodeDeploy: Poll for new deployments
    CodeDeploy-->>-Hosts: Notify Hosts of new deployment
    Hosts->>+S3: Fetch Revision from S3
    S3-->>-Hosts: Receives Revision
    Hosts->>Hosts: Install and run application from Revision
`}/>

Here, `Revision` refers to our software bundle and a manifest file following the CodeDeploy format, including 
deployment scripts and all application configs.

While functional, this setup had presented challenges:

- **Agent upkeep**: CodeDeploy agents required monitoring and updates. 

    Sometimes the agent may go down
    for an unknown reason, and we deployments would mysteriously hang until we manually restarted the agent.
    
- **IAM complexity**: AWS permissions for CodeDeploy Agents were separate from our SSO-based access controls.

    We already manage our own access to all of our servers, as well as our AWS and other accounts through SSO,
    so having another place where we had to manage permissions was a pain. Further, it was ambiguous who was 
    responsible for policies around these IAM roles, since it didn't fall into our normal process.

- **Static secrets**: Credentials persisted on hosts, posing security risks.

    Certain credentials needed for deployments (e.g., container registry credentials) were stored on the hosts 
    themselves. This was because there wasn't a way to safely send these credentials to the hosts from Github's
    secret manager without bundling them in the Revisions - which would have been bigger security concern.

- **Disjointed logs**: Tracking deployments meant jumping between GitHub Actions and AWS.

    Since the deployment process was split between GitHub Actions and CodeDeploy, it was hard to track down 
    issues that occurred during deployments. Everytime a deployment happens, I ended up manually observing
    the CodeDeploy log in the machine. Piping this to a central log store was another option, but it would have
    been another moving part to manage.

- **Enviroment-bound artifacts**: Environment-specific changes required rebuilding artifacts.

    We wanted to manage the configurations in code with Github, but the multiple hops needed to transfer something 
    from Github Actions to the host meant that it was easier for us to bake the application configs right into the 
    artifact, otherwise we would have had to invent yet another series of back-and-forth to get the configs to the 
    host. This meant that we had to rebuild the artifact for every environment, which was a pain, and an anti-pattern
    since what was tested was not guaranteed to be what gets deployed to production.

    Another consequence of this was that we could not simply create a new environment and deploy an existing artifact,
    so we were limited in how we could grow our infrastructure.

- **No inventory management**:

    We had to manually keep track of which hosts were in which environment, and what was running on them.
    Documentation can only go so far, and answering the question "what's running on this machine" was harder than
    it should have been.

You might be wondering now why did we have to use CodeDeploy in the first place? 

The answer: **Security**.

Because Github Actions were running in Github's cloud, CodeDeploy allowed us to push deployments from Github
Actions to our servers without having to open up their access to Github.

# The Redesign: Combining Self-Hosted Runners and Ansible
To address these challenges, we reworked the pipeline with two key changes:

1. **Self-Hosted GitHub Actions Runners**

    It might have been the case that the system was set up long before this was an option, frankly I don't know...
    We had already started to host our own runners purely for cost-saving measure, but the implication of it was that
    our workflows should now be able to safely access our servers which are all within the same network!

    The natural thing for us to explore was how to get our workflows to access these machines... Which had a simple 
    answer:

1. **Ansible for Agentless Automation**

    As a developer, code is the first tool I naturally reach for when solving a problem. Ansible, lets me do just that.
    I've been using Ansible since 2018, but this was a new technology for the team at the time, so naturally, getting
    some buy-in was my first priority. 

    I started with targetting one machine which we use for development and testing, the goal was to get this one machine
    redeployed everytime a commit was pushed to `master`. This is a low-risk way to test the waters, and showcase
    the benefits of a new tool. A simple playbook over a weekend, and voila! We had a working deployment pipeline.

Here’s the updated flow:

<Mermaid chart={`
sequenceDiagram
    participant SelfHostedRunner as Self-Hosted Runner
    participant S3
    participant Hosts as Hosts

    rect rgba(200, 200, 255, 0.2)
        note right of SelfHostedRunner: Build Artifact Workflow
        SelfHostedRunner->>SelfHostedRunner: Build artifact
        SelfHostedRunner->>S3: Push artifact to S3
    end

    rect rgba(200, 255, 200, 0.2)
        note right of SelfHostedRunner: Deployment Workflow
        SelfHostedRunner->>Hosts: Execute Ansible playbook
        Hosts->>+S3: Download artifact from S3
        S3-->>-Hosts: Receives artifact
        Hosts->>Hosts: Install and deploy new application
        Hosts-->>SelfHostedRunner: Ansible playbook completes
    end
`}/>

Now instead of a single workflow, we have two distinct workflows: one for building the artifact, and another 
for deploying it. Not that this was not possible with CodeDeploy, but it would have taken a lot more effort.

After a couple of weeks of testing, this approach has taken over how we deploy to non-production targets.
That's when we knew it was time to take this to production.

Here the goal was to use the exact same Ansible playbook to deploy to production as we did for other servers.
We did however take the opportunity to create a new deployment account for production, which was only present
on a new dedicated github runner which had access to the production servers. There certainly some minor
variation between the Github workflows used for production vs non-production, mainly to support a few input
parameters that were needed for safety.


# Why This Approach Works Better
Notify Hosts of new deployment

  1. **One less agent in production**
  
      Replacing CodeDeploy with Ansible meant we no longer have to keep an agent running on our host machines.
      We still have other agents there of course, sucha as an Elastic agent for log and security monitoring, but
      if we can have one less process in production, that's always a win.

  1. **Dynamic secrets**
  
      Since we can easily pass secrets from Github Actions to Ansible, we no longer have to store secrets 
      any credential on the host machines. This is a big plus for security.

  1. **Centralized inventory**
  
      Servers are all managed via Ansible’s inventory files, the question of "What machine is used for what" is now
      answered simply by looking at the inventory file.

  1. **Configurations decoupled**

      Environment-specific settings were stored separately, enabling "build once, deploy anywhere.". 

  1. **Central Access Control from SSO provider**

      We no longer have a strange IAM role that we have to manage, all access is managed through our SSO provider.
      If an SSH key is compromised, we can easily rotate it and revoke access just like how we would with
      our own individual accounts.

  1. **Flexible Configurations**

      Since Ansible can push just the right config to each target host, we can now reused the artifact across 
      environments by overriding configurations at deploy time. Adding new environment became much simpler, so we 
      now have 4 of them :D (ok arguably that might be too much for us... but that's story for another time).

  1. **Unified Visibility**

      Gone are the days I'd have to jump through hoops to find out what happened during a deployment, everything 
      is immediately visible on Github. Thankfully, Github also does a great job dedacting secrets from the logs,
      so we aren't compromised if a secret is accidentally printed to the logs either.


# Closing Thoughts

It took some time to evolve the whole system, but today this is how we deploy virtually everything. Thankfully
since those days, we have also gained a new valuable team member whose chop with Ansible is second to none, 
so not only are my deployments but also the provisioning of our servers are also codified.

Though I'm not fully an infrastructure-type, the process of improving a system is always a fun challenge.
There will always be new approaches to try, and new tools to learn. I like wearing many technical hats 🤠
