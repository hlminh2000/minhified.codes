# Introduction

Somehow for the entirety of my career, I've got away without a portfolio site... I decided to change
that this year. I didn't want a "resume on a webpage", I already have a LinkedIn page. I wanted a unique
product where I can continuously build and experiment on, a space where I can share my journey in building
tech, using tech. 

All that seemed like a lot of work, and I'm no designer, so of course I enlisted some help from a few AI 
friends, and the page you're on was put together in under 2 days (minus the writing of blog posts - I write
these myself).

Though I have a lot of other tools and thoughts that are worth going into, I want to focus this post on 
how AI tools made this timeline possible. There will be more posts to come about everything else involved.

## TLDR, here's what I used:
1. **Gemini** for concept generation
1. **ChatGPT** for prompt generation
1. **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** for initial code generation
1. **v0.dev** for initial implementation
1. **Copilot** for ongoing development

## **ChatGPT** for prompt generation
  
I started with my own prompt:
> Generate me a concept for portfolio webpage design to showcase my work as a full-stack engineer. 
  Imagine something that's modern, simple but creative, dark theme with gradient. Have sections for 
  "about me", "timeline", "blog", "get in touch".

After feeding this to a few models, the result was underwhelming, so I thought the prompt could be better. 
I took the original prompt and dropped it into ChatGPT again, asking it to improve the prompt, like so:

> improve this prompt for better result: `Generate me a concept for portfolio webpage design to showcase my work as a senior full-stack engineer. Imagine something that's modern, simple but creative, dark theme with gradient. Have sections for "about me", "timeline", "blog", "get in touch".`

Which yielded:

> Design a concept for a portfolio webpage to showcase the work of a senior full-stack engineer. 
The design should be modern, minimalistic, and creative, with a dark theme enhanced by subtle 
gradient accents. Include clearly defined sections: 'About Me' featuring a profile photo, a concise 
bio, and a navigation bar; 'Timeline' showcasing career milestones in an elegant vertical layout; 
'Blog' displaying previews of posts in a clean grid format with bold typography; and 
'Get in Touch' with a sleek contact form and prominent social media icons. Emphasize a professional 
yet engaging aesthetic, using smooth transitions, well-placed highlights, and a balanced layout.

Clearly this is a much better prompt that actually describe what I was going for. Dropping this into Claude
gave the following

## Claude for initial code generation

My original prompt with Claude yielded the following:

<div className='relative overflow-scroll h-96 rounded-lg'>
  <OldPromptDesign />
</div>

With the improved prompt that ChatGPT gave me, the result was as follow:

<div className='relative overflow-scroll h-96 rounded-lg'>
  <Portfolio />
</div>

Already, you can see the resemblance to the site you're on. The original code, if you're interested,
