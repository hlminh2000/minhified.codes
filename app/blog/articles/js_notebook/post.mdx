title: Jupyter Notebook for the JS-minded

  If you're a weirdo like me, you want to code interactively in Jupyter Notebooks but you don't want 
  to deal with python and would prefer JS (or TS for that matter), this might help.

# Why?...

Well, I love using [Observable.hq](https://observablehq.com/) for communicating lightweight data research, 
but the idea of all my work being hosted exclusively by a service is not very appealing... Python folks 
have Jupyter notebooks, which I really like, but frankly Python just doesn't "spark joy" for me... so I 
looked for a way to run JS (and prefarably TS) in Jupyter. Turned out it works quite well!

# The solution

Here's an `npm` package to help:
```bash
npm install -g tslab
tslab install -g
```

And, if you're as big a weirdo as me, and want the whole setup to be replicatable, here's a Dockerfile
that has everything set up:

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:jammy

# Prevent interactive prompts during package installation
ENV DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive

# Install basic utilities and dependencies
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
  curl \
  git \
  python3 \
  python3-pip \
  build-essential \
  apt-transport-https \
  ca-certificates \
  software-properties-common \
  && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Install Docker
RUN curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh \
  && sh get-docker.sh \
  && rm get-docker.sh

# Install Node.js 20 from NodeSource
RUN curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | bash - \
  && apt-get install -y nodejs \
  && npm install -g npm@latest

# Create a non-root user that will be mapped to the host user
ARG USERNAME=vscode
ARG USER_UID=1000
ARG USER_GID=$USER_UID

# Create the user
RUN groupadd --gid $USER_GID $USERNAME \
    && useradd --uid $USER_UID --gid $USER_GID -m $USERNAME \
    && mkdir -p /etc/sudoers.d \
    && echo $USERNAME ALL=\(root\) NOPASSWD:ALL > /etc/sudoers.d/$USERNAME \
    && chmod 0440 /etc/sudoers.d/$USERNAME

# Add user to docker group
RUN usermod -aG docker $USERNAME

# Install global Node.js packages
RUN npm install -g tslab \
    && mkdir -p /home/$USERNAME/.local/share/jupyter/kernels \
    && chown -R $USERNAME:$USERNAME /home/$USERNAME/.local

# Install Jupyter Notebook for the user
RUN pip3 install notebook

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /workspace
RUN chown $USERNAME:$USERNAME /workspace

# Switch to non-root user
USER $USERNAME

# Setup tslab for the user
RUN tslab install

# Default command
CMD ["/bin/bash"]
```

And a `devcontainer.json` to follow:

```json
// For format details, see https://aka.ms/devcontainer.json. For config options, see the
// README at: https://github.com/devcontainers/templates/tree/main/src/ubuntu
{
	"name": "Ubuntu",
	"build": {
		"dockerfile": "../Dockerfile",
		"args": {
			"USERNAME": "vscode",
			"USER_UID": "1000",
			"USER_GID": "1000"
		}
	},
	"mounts": [
		"source=/var/run/docker.sock,target=/var/run/docker.sock,type=bind"
	],
	"remoteUser": "vscode",
	"updateRemoteUserUID": true
}

```

# Usecase
So what do I actually use this for? Mostly for writing light data-wrangling pipelines, and 
building llm agents :P I like to work in JS for the smooth translation into a product with
vercel's AI sdk.

# Limitations
One big one is visualization... stepping away from Python means stepping away from a lot of 
heavy weight tools in the data science world, including the amazing stuff backed by `matplotlib`
... Ironically the frontend language that is JS does make this more tricky.

Technically tslab does provide support for rich media presentation with html, but who wants
to really write out big html and svg manually... Jupiter Magic might also help here, but I
haven't tried it out yet... We may find out more in future.
