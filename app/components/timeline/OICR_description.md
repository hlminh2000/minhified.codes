The Ontario Institute for Cancer Research (OICR) is a collaborative, not-for-profit research institute that conducts and enables high-impact translational cancer research to accelerate the development of discoveries for patients around the world while maximizing the economic benefit of this research for the people of Ontario.

As part of the software engineering team, I helped build systems that enabled researchers to share, access and analyze large-scale genomic data.

My work included developing web applications, APIs, and data processing pipelines, as well as maintaining open-source tools used across multiple projects.

Here I also learned about and got to contribute to the operations of a large-scale software project, including CI/CD, containerization, cloud infrastructure, and IaC tools. The learnings here continue to be in my toolbox today. üß∞
